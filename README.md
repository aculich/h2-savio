# Overview

This repo will document a setup that is standard best practice for shared
research directories on an HPC cluster. It prevents permission conflicts and
ensures seamless collaboration among research group members. 

- ‚úÖ *Collaborative Access* - All files and directories belong to the research group fc_winerev, ensuring smooth collaboration.
- ‚úÖ *Automatic Group Inheritance* - New files/directories automatically belong to fc_winerev (via g+s).
- ‚úÖ *Shared Read/Write Permissions* - Everyone in fc_winerev can read and modify any file.
- ‚úÖ *Prevents Permission Issues* - Avoids problems where files have different owners/groups that prevent modifications.
- ‚ùå *Private files* - Avoids problems where files are lost due to permission issues in $HOME directories or unreadbale/unwritable in group directories.

These commands are configuring the directory `/global/home/groups/fc_winerev` on
the Savio HPC cluster for a faculty condo group called `fc_winerev`. Below is a
breakdown of what each command does and why it‚Äôs useful for collaborative work.

## **Graphic Representation of Unix File Permissions**  
Below is a visual representation of a common Unix file permission mode, similar to the style in your attached screenshot.

## **Table 1: Unix File Permissions Breakdown**  
This table shows the basic Unix file permissions in octal notation, their corresponding symbolic representation, and what they mean.  

| **Octal** | **String Representation** | **Permissions** |
|---------|----------------------|--------------------|
| **0**  | --- | No Permission |
| **1**  | --x | Execute |
| **2**  | -w- | Write |
| **3**  | -wx | Write + Execute |
| **4**  | r-- | Read |
| **5**  | r-x | Read + Execute |
| **6**  | rw- | Read + Write |
| **7**  | rwx | Read + Write + Execute |

## **Table 2: Common Unix File and Directory Modes**  
This table lists common octal permission modes for files and directories, explaining their usage.  

| **Mode (Octal Representation)** | **Description** |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **000** | No permissions for anyone |
| **644** | Regular file: owner can read/write, others can only read |
| **600** | Private file: only owner can read/write |
| **666** | All users can read/write (not recommended) |
| **755** | Executable file: owner can read/write/execute, others can read/execute |
| **700** | Private executable file: only owner can read/write/execute |
| **777** | Full access (read/write/execute) for everyone (not recommended) |
| **700** | Private directory: only owner can access |
| **750** | Directory accessible by owner and group |
| **755** | Public directory: owner can write, others can read/execute |

---

## **Table 3: Special 4-Digit Octal Permissions**  
These are special permission modes using four-digit octal values, including **SetUID, SetGID, and the Sticky Bit**.  

| **Mode (Octal Representation)** | **Description** |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **1777** | Sticky bit: everyone can write, but only the owner can delete their own files (common for `/tmp`) |
| **2755** | SetGID: Executable runs with the group‚Äôs permissions |
| **2700** | Private directory with SetGID: only group members can access |
| **4755** | SetUID: Executable runs with the owner‚Äôs permissions |
| **4000** | SetUID: File executes as the file owner |
| **2000** | SetGID: File executes as the group owner |
| **1000** | Sticky bit: Restricts file deletion in shared directories |

üöÄ Explanation of Each Command and Its Impact on an HPC Cluster Research Group

## 1. Change Group Ownership Recursively

`chgrp -R fc_winerev /global/home/groups/fc_winerev`

What It Does:
- Changes the group ownership of all files and directories inside `/global/home/groups/fc_winerev` to the research group `fc_winerev`.
- The `-R` (recursive) option ensures it applies to all files and subdirectories.

Why?
- Ensures that all files in this shared space belong to the fc_winerev group.
- Any user in fc_winerev will have group-level access to these files (depending on permissions).

## 2. Set Group Permissions on Directories

`find /global/home/groups/fc_winerev -type d -exec chmod g+o,g+s {} +`

What It Does:
- `find ... -type d`: Finds all directories inside `/global/home/groups/fc_winerev`.
- `chmod g+o,g+s {}:`
- `g+o`: Ensures group members get the same permissions as the owner (group ownership matches the user‚Äôs permissions).
- `g+s`: SetGID (Set Group ID) on directories, ensuring that:
- New files and subdirectories inside will inherit the group fc_winerev instead of the user‚Äôs primary group.
- This is essential in collaborative research environments so files don‚Äôt end up owned by different groups.

Why?
- Maintains consistent group ownership when users create files, avoiding permission issues where only the file creator can modify files.
- Ensures everyone in the group can access shared directories properly.

## 3. Set Group Permissions on Files

`find /global/home/groups/fc_winerev -type f -exec chmod g+o,g+rw {} +`

What It Does:
- `find ... -type f`: Finds all files inside `/global/home/groups/fc_winerev`.
- `chmod g+o,g+rw {}:`
- `g+o`: Makes sure group permissions match the owner‚Äôs permissions.
- `g+rw`: Grants read (r) and write (w) access to the fc_winerev group.

Why?
- Ensures that any file created inside this shared research space is readable and writable by all members of the research group.
- Prevents scenarios where one user creates a file that others cannot modify.
